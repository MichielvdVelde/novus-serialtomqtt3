# Novus Serial to MQTT

This component is an implementation of [novus-component](https://github.com/MichielvdVelde/novus-component) for use by my home automation
system, Novus.

This component connects to the [Arduino](https://github.com/MichielvdVelde/novus-arduino-sketch) over serial, and allows bi-directional
communication, which is relayed over MQTT. This allows both the sensors and the
switch controls to be accessed (see [the Arduino sketch](https://github.com/MichielvdVelde/novus-arduino-sketch) for more info).

This code is useless for anyone besides me, although you're free to browse and copy/steal
what you think you can use.
